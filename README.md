  <h3>Enhancing the Tourism Experience in Boston</h3>

## üåÜ Project Overview

The Boston Tourism Management System (BTMS) is an integrated platform designed to enhance tourism experiences in Boston by connecting key stakeholders such as attractions, transportation providers, hotels, and event planners. BTMS addresses the fragmented nature of tourism services by providing a centralized system that benefits both tourists and businesses.

## üåü Problem Statement

Boston is a city rich in history and culture, making it one of the best places to visit in the United States. However, tourists often face a fragmented experience due to:

- Difficulty finding real-time information about places, events, and transportation
- Lack of an integrated booking system for tickets, accommodation, and tours
- Insufficient information for optimizing travel plans, leading to wasted time and resources
- Poor communication between tourism businesses (event organizers, hotels, transportation providers)

These gaps result in decreased tourist satisfaction and missed revenue opportunities for businesses.
