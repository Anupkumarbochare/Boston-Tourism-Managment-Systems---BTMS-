Boston Tourism Management System

Problem Statement:

Boston is a city full of history and culture. It is one of the best places to visit in the United States. 
The experience for tourists is usually fragmented because there is a lack of cooperation between key groups: 
attractions, transportation, hotels, and event planners. Tourists face numerous issues, such as: 

● It's hard to find real-time information about places, events, and transportation. 

● No integrated booking system for tickets, accommodation, and tours. 

● Not enough information on improving travel plans, which often causes waste of time and travel resources. 

● Poor communication between businesses, like event organizers and hotels. These gaps result in decreased tourist satisfaction and missed revenue opportunities for the businesses.


Objectives and Goals:

The Boston Tourism Management System will be able to provide one integrated platform for key tourism services, ensuring tourists an overall seamless experience and smoothing operations for all stakeholders. 
Key Features:
● One-stop management of attractions, events, transportation, and hospitality. 

● Dashboards for tourists and businesses to manage activities easily. 

● Information on events, bus and train timings, and details of hotel and restaurant availability. 

● Communication among various organizations to coordinate resources, such as shuttles for events or rooms for conferences. 

● Using data analysis to help businesses improve their tourism services and forecast trends.
